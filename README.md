##Topics for Twitter##

Keyword-based topic filters for Twitter, developed using csdl language (from Datasift). The keywords can be easily translated to any programming language with Boolean operators.

There are two folders of topic filters, including blocklists shared by multiple topics (in the shared folder), and the topic files targeting eyewitness language. Eyewitness topics include shootings, a broad police activity topic (catches more language, but also noisier), a narrow police activity topic (more focused language, less noisy), and protests.
